Over the years it has grown enormously, both in terms of people and infrastructure. As of 2020, we are over 1000 students and more than 300 staff, including around 70 academic staff. We have received considerable investment in infrastructure and facilities to support excellence in Research and Teaching. This includes our innovative Bioscience Technology Facility and the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (CNAP). The Queenâ€™s Award-winning York Structural Biology Laboratory (YSBL) is part of the Department of Chemistry but located on the Biology site.",
