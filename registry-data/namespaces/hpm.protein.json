    "description": "The Human Proteome Map (HPM) portal integrates the peptide sequencing result from the draft map of the human proteome project. The project was based on LC-MS/MS by utilizing of high resolution and high accuracy Fourier transform mass spectrometry. The HPM contains direct evidence of translation of a number of protein products derived from human genes, based on peptide identifications of multiple organs/tissues and cell types from individuals with clinically defined healthy tissues. The HPM portal provides data on individual proteins, as well as on individual peptide spectra. This collection references proteins.",
