Currently, CIViC accepts publications indexed on PubMed OR abstracts published through the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Each such source entered into CIViC is assigned a unique identifier and expert curators can curate guidance that assists future curators in the interpretation of information from this source.",
