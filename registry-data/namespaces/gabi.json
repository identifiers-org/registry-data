The focus is on the human genome. The scientists work with automated methods and high-throughput technologies for a systematic analysis of genes and genomes and use a number of different models. The analysis and interpretation of the results is done using computational methods, the close connection of experimental and computational methods is one of the main features of many departments and groups at the MPIMG.",
