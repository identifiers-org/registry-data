    "description": "Computational gene function prediction can serve to focus experimental resources on high-priority experimental tasks. FuncBase is a web resource for viewing quantitative machine learning-based gene function annotations. Quantitative annotations of genes, including fungal and mammalian genes, with Gene Ontology terms are accompanied by a community feedback system. Evidence underlying function annotations is shown. FuncBase provides links to external resources, and may be accessed directly or via links from species-specific databases. This collection references yeast.",
