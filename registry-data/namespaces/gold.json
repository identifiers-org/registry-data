            "description": "The Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) is a centralized resource for cataloguing genome and metagenome sequencing projects from around the world, along with their associated metadata. Information in GOLD is organized into four levels: Study, Biosample/Organism, Sequencing Project and Analysis Project. \nStudy is an umbrella Project that broadly defines the overall goal of a research proposal. It consists of sequencing projects along with corresponding organism or Biosample information as well as any analysis done on the sequencing projects.\nE.g., Gs0016050: Human Microbiome Project (HMP), Gs0000008: A Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) study.\nBiosample is the description of the environment from where the DNA/RNA sample was collected. Currently GOLD Biosample entities are defined for all metagenome and metatranscriptomes projects, i.e. for non-isolate genomes. E.g., Gb0055733\nOrganism is an individual living thing. It can be a bacterium, plant, fungus etc. In GOLD, all isolate or single cell genome sequencing projects are associated with an organism. Additionally, GOLD Organisms are also created for genomes assembled from metagenome sequences(MAGs). E.g., Go0003442\nSequencing Project represents the procedures undertaken for generating sequencing output from an individual Organism or Biosample. An individual genome project may be composed of more than one sequencing reactions and/or sequencing technologies. A Sequencing Project may be an isolate genome, or a metagenome, transcriptome, or metatranscriptome etc.\nE.g., Gp0003442\nAnalysis Project represents the computational processing of sequencing data generated by a sequencing project. It describes how the assembly and annotation of a Sequencing Project were performed. \nE.g., Ga0027275",
