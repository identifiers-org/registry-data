            "description": "E-cyanobacterium is a web-based platform for public sharing, annotation, analysis, and visualisation of dynamical models and wet-lab experiments related to cyanobacteria. It allows models to be represented at different levels of abstraction — as biochemical reaction networks or ordinary differential equations. It provides concise mappings of mathematical models to a formalised consortium-agreed biochemical description, with the aim of connecting the world of biological knowledge with benefits of mathematical description of dynamic processes. This collection references wet-lab experiments.",
