    "description": "Evidence Items are the central building block of the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) knowledgebase. The clinical Evidence Item is a piece of information that has been manually curated from trustable medical literature about a Variant or genomic ‘event’ that has implications in cancer Predisposition, Diagnosis (aka molecular classification), Prognosis, Predictive response to therapy, Oncogenicity or protein Function. For example, an Evidence Item might describe a line of evidence supporting the notion that tumors with a somatic BRAF V600 mutation generally respond well to the drug dabrafenib. A Variant may be a single nucleotide substitution, a small insertion or deletion, an RNA gene fusion, a chromosomal rearrangement, an RNA expression pattern (e.g. over-expression), etc. Each clinical Evidence statement corresponds to a single citable Source (a publication or conference abstract).",
