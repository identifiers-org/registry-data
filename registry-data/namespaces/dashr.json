    "description": "DASHR reports the annotation, expression and evidence for specific RNA processing (cleavage specificity scores/entropy) of human sncRNA genes, precursor and mature sncRNA products across different human tissues and cell types. DASHR integrates information from multiple existing annotation resources for small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), Piwi-interacting (piRNAs), small nuclear (snRNAs), nucleolar (snoRNAs), cytoplasmic (scRNAs), transfer (tRNAs), tRNA fragments (tRFs), and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). These datasets were obtained from non-diseased human tissues and cell types and were generated for studying or profiling small non-coding RNAs. This collection references RNA records.",
