Molecular methods have found their way into all branches of biology. Our department attempts to be at the cutting edge – utilisation of novel molecular techniques has become the rule rather than exception. At the same time, we have not forgotten classical botany and ecology – we still respect our plants and fungi and teach our students to be able to identify them from sight.",
