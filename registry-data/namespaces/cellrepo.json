We seek to create the next generation of algorithms that provide innovative solutions to problems arising in natural complex systems (e.g. in biology, chemistry, physics) as well as synthetic ones (e.g. in biological engineering, health care, software engineering) and derive new knowledge from them. To accomplish its mission, the group leverages its interdisciplinary expertise in Machine Intelligence, Complex Systems and Computational Biology and pursues collaborative activities with relevant stakeholders.",
