DANDI works with BICCN and other BRAIN Initiative awardees to curate data using community data standards such as NWB and BIDS, and to make data and software for cellular neurophysiology FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). DANDI will store electrical and optical cellular neurophysiology recordings and associated MRI and/or optical imaging data. DANDI will provide: 1) A cloud platform for neurophysiology data storage for the purposes of collaboration and dissemination of data; 2) Easy to use tools for neurophysiology data submission, visualization, and access in the archive; and 3) Standardized applications for data ingestion, visualization and processing, which facilitate adoption of NWB and other standards. These data will help scientists uncover and understand cellular level mechanisms of brain function. Scientists will study the formation of neural networks, how cells and networks enable functions such as learning and memory, and how these functions are disrupted in neurological disorders.",
