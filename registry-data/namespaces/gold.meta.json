Sequencing technologies have allowed us to begin decoding the information encoded in the DNA of microbes in the wild, providing a snapshot of diversity and metabolic functional potential. Knowledge of how microbes function in their environment holds tremendous potential to transform our understanding of the world and spur innovations in energy and the environment.",
