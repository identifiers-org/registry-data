    "description": "ClassyFire is a web-based application for automated structural classification of chemical entities. This application uses a rule-based approach that relies on a comprehensible, comprehensive, and computable chemical taxonomy. ClassyFire provides a hierarchical chemical classification of chemical entities (mostly small molecules and short peptide sequences), as well as a structure-based textual description, based on a chemical taxonomy named ChemOnt, which covers 4825 chemical classes of organic and inorganic compounds. Moreover, ClassyFire allows for text-based search via its web interface. It can be accessed via the web interface or via the ClassyFire API.",
