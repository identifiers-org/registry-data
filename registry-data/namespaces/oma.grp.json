    "description": "OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) is a database that identifies orthologs among publicly available, complete genome sequences. It identifies orthologous relationships which can be accessed either group-wise, where all group members are orthologous to all other group members, or on a sequence-centric basis, where for a given protein all its orthologs in all other species are displayed. This collection references groupings of orthologs.",
