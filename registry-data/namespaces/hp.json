Medical genetics connects basic research with clinical medicine and thereby allows for the application of findings when making predictive and preventive assessments. In addition to the standard methods used for diagnostics, medical genetics makes use of an increasing number of molecular genetic methods. The use of these methods enables us to identify an ever increasing number of genetic diseases. Molecular genetics exhibits an exceptional potential to assist us in the comprehension of the etiology and pathogenesis of diseases and will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic concepts.",
