We combine genetic, biochemical, molecular, cell biological and quantitative approaches to investigate fundamental biological processes across a range of organisms, from viruses and microbes to plants, worms, flies, fish and mammals. We are committed to excellence in research and teaching, and offer students a diversity of course offerings and research opportunities. The commonalities of our research interests combined with varied experimental approaches help forge a rigorous yet interdisciplinary and collaborative environment.",
