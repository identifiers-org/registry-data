    "description": "Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) provides public access to custom mass spectral libraries, metabolite profiling experiments as well as additional information and tools. Since metabolites often cannot be obtained in their respective native biological state, for example organic acids may be only acquirable as salts, the concept of reference substance was introduced. This collection references reference substances.",

The founding director was Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Lothar Willmitzer, who is the director of one of the three departments which have been established since then. From originally only 16 employees the institute grew into a large institute, which now employs about 360 people from all over the world, who put their combined efforts into elucidating the secrets of plants.",
