    "description": "A curated database of 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs. In the current update, the UTR entries are organized in a gene-centric structure to better visualize and retrieve 5' and 3'UTR variants generated by alternative initiation and termination of transcription and alternative splicing. Experimentally validated miRNA targets and conserved sequence elements are also annotated. The integration of UTRdb with genomic data has allowed the implementation of an efficient annotation system and a powerful retrieval resource for the selection and extraction of specific UTR subsets.

The University was named after one of its most famous students, the statesman Aldo Moro. Moro taught Criminal Law at the University of Bari for several years. The university offers various courses for undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students. Aside from teaching, the university is also focused on scientific research at the doctorate level. The University of Bari research centres are highly-interactive, having connections among different departments, universities, and other research centres.",
