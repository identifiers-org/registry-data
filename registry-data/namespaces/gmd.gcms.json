Analytes are subjected to a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer, which records the mass spectrum and the retention time linked to an analyte. This collection references GC-MS spectra.",

The founding director was Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Lothar Willmitzer, who is the director of one of the three departments which have been established since then. From originally only 16 employees the institute grew into a large institute, which now employs about 360 people from all over the world, who put their combined efforts into elucidating the secrets of plants.",
