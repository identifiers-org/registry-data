    "description": "The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) collates data on germ-line mutations in nuclear genes associated with human inherited disease. It includes information on single base-pair substitutions in coding, regulatory and splicing-relevant regions; micro-deletions and micro-insertions; indels; triplet repeat expansions as well as gross deletions; insertions; duplications; and complex rearrangements. Each mutation entry is unique, and includes cDNA reference sequences for most genes, splice junction sequences, disease-associated and functional polymorphisms, as well as links to data present in publicly available online locus-specific mutation databases.",
